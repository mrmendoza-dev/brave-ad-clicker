# Brave Ad Clicker
- Currently only compatible with Windows 10/11
- [Brave](https://brave.com/) is a web browser that rewards users with cryptocurrency BAT tokens for viewing ads
- This Python program uses the pyautogui library to detect a Brave ad popup (Only on Windows 10), which will then open and close the ad, returning the cursor to the previous location uninterrupted
- Meant to be used during active computer use, Brave Browser is able to detect human vs machine interactions to prevent ad farming
